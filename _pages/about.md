I'm a theoretical physicist, native from Mexico City :hot_pepper: ðŸ¥‘ :corn:

I currently work as a Senior Quantum Engineer at [IQM Quantum Computers](https://www.meetiqm.com/), in Munich, Germany.
My work is focused mainly on theory aspects of Quantum Characterization, Verification & Validation (QCVV).
Together with colleagues at IQM, I initiated the development of a Python package for QCVV, now open-sourced as [IQM Benchmarks](https://github.com/iqm-finland/iqm-benchmarks).
I'm unofficially a [cycling enthusiast](https://www.strava.com/athletes/pedrofigro) and [ex-guitar player](https://youtu.be/8FZgNRJ9QJY) turned mandolin player.
I also used to do some [street photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pedrofigrom/) !
